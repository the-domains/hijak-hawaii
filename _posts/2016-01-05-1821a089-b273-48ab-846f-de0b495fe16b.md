The Hawaii Polo Club on the North Shore

One of my favorite weekend getaways has to be Polo.  The field is located right on the beach and feels just like Narnia, I am still waiting to see a Two headed Gazelle come prancing right out out of the Water.  Most Regular Matches are played on Sunday afternoon.  The Gates open at 12 Noon and usually close around dusk unless you are privy to know the owners and get to stay a little longer ;)  As a Member you get to use the Clubhouse and have covered seating, access to the bar and personal Chef who makes delightful Mid-day Fare.  Many of the Spouses of the Players Cheer and roar and get quite lively.  There are always some interesting cats that are well dressed and have a few wild tales to tell. 

You can also tailgate, bring your own booze and go in just as a guest and park your car, set up a tent and chairs and enjoy the match on the beach side or near the entrance where there is always some musical entertainment after the matches.  There is also a special treat of Skydivers that put on a show between matches.  

So join me or come on your own and enjoy Polo fro the Beginning of April through October!!
